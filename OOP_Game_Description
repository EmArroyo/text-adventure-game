OOP ADVENTURE GAME

The character starts at the top of a tower, in an empty room with nothing in it but a backpack. The player collects the backpack which has the ability to store items found in other rooms of the tower.

Upon exiting the room by going down the staircase, the player finds itself in a lobby type of room, with a locked door to the stairs going down and four doors, one in each of the cardinal directions:

	- North: This room is a green bedroom. There is a bed, an armchair, a window and a fire. There is a mug on the bed and a candle on the window sill.
	- East: This is a bathroom. There is a bathtub, a sink and a toilet. On the sink there is a towel that the player can pickup.
	- South: This is a library. There is an armchair by the fire and a small coffee table by it. On the coffee table there is a small red key and a book.
	- West: This is a dining room. In the middle of the room there is a long table, flanked by 6 chairs on each side. On top of the table there is a vase with some flowers in it. There is a maid in it that will let the player know "The front door can be drafty in windy days like today".

To continue downstairs, the player must be in posession of the small red key.

Once downstairs, the player finds itself in a lobby type of room again, door to the stairs locked and four more rooms, one to each of the cardinal directions:

	- North: This room is a kitchen. There is plenty of food on the counter, as if someone was planning to cook a meal for a gathering. Next to the stove there is a cheese sandwich and a teapot. The cook is standing in it and will tell the player "The gatekeeper has not had his lunch."
	- East: This is a utility room. There is a strange black lever on one of the shelfs.
	- South: This is an airing cupboard. There is a thick blanket and a pair of boots.
	- West: This is a study room. There are bookshelves to the right hand side and a big desk under the window. On the desk, there is a small blue key. There is a little boy that will tell the player "Stading by that door all day and night must be really boring. If it was me, I'd spend the day reading."

To continue downstairs, the player must be in posession of the small blue key.

Once downstairs, the player finds itself in a big entrance room, only one door can be seen and the gatekeeper is standing next to it. The gatekeeper will inform the player that to leave the house he/she must satisfy his demands and proceed to release a random statement of a set of three:

	- I am cold. Give blanket and boots.
	- I am hungry. Give cheese sandwich, mug and teapot.
	- I am bored. Give book and candle.
